		<h1>Updating Content</h1>
		<p>Updating Content consists of elements that constantly change, such as clocks and scrolling advertisements.</p>
		<h3>Accessible Updating Content</h3>
		<p>Updating Content can be tricky to make completely accessible.  Unlike dynamic elements that only change through user action, items that constantly change should not have every update recognized by VoiceOver.  Implementing updating content in this way will make the app more difficult to navigate and use for VoiceOver users.  However, this should not be counteracted by not making the element an accessibility element, for unsighted users should receive the same information through VoiceOver that sighted users obtain through visuals.  Below, we address how to mark elements as accessibility elements, so that VoiceOver can relay information about them to the user.</p>
		<h3>Marking an Element as Accessible</h3>
		<p>To make sure the updating element is marked as an accessibility element, follow the instructions below.
		<h4>Using Storyboard Editor</h4>
		<p>Storyboard Editor is the easiest way to make an element accessible if it was created in the Storyboard.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Go to your Storyboard Editor in XCode.</li>
			<li>Click on the element that you want to make accessible.</li>
			<li>Open the Identity Inspector on the right side of XCode. (Click on the third icon from the left in the bar on the right side - see image below)</li><br>
			<img src = "Images/UpdatingContentII.png" alt = "Image of the location of the 'Identity Inspector' button">
			<li>Scroll down to "Accessibility" and make sure that the checkbox labeled "Accessibility Enabled" is checked. (See image below)</li><br>
			<img src = "Images/UpdatingContentA11yEnabled.png" alt = "Image of the Accessibility section in the Identity Inspector with 'Enabled' checked off">
		</ol>
		<h4>Programmatic Approach</h4>
		<p>These steps are useful if the updating content was created programmatically instead of through Storyboard.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Pull up the implementation (.m) file that contains the element.</li>
			<li>Underneath where the element was created, add <code><i>object</i>.accessibilityElement = YES;</code> where <i>object</i> is the element you want to mark as accessible.</li>
		</ol>
		Your element should now be accessible!  It is important to note that with updating content, usually just making an element an accessibility element is not enough.</p>
		<h3>Finding the Balance</h3>
		<p>Every situation will be slightly different as to the best way to implement accessibility for updating content.  It should have enough accessibility that VoiceOver users know what is focused and have a general sense of its content; however, it should not have so many notifications from VoiceOver that it disrupts usability and functionality of the app.  Let's, for example, say that I want to implement a clock displaying the current hour, minute, and second.  When a user tabs over to the clock, it should not announce the time every second, for VoiceOver will not be able to fully state the time in a second.  It will fall behind on notifications very quickly and relay outdated information to the user.  (So, the clock may display 4:25:45 PM, but VoiceOver will say that it is 4:25:42 PM.)  The clock also should not have its <code>accessibilityElement</code> property set to <code>NO</code>; instead, it would be better to have the clock only announce the hour and minute or announce the full time once every 5 seconds.</p>
		<h3>Potential Issues</h3>
		<p>With only the updating item marked as an accessibility element with no extra accessibility features added, a few different things could occur:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The accessibility label may automatically change everytime the content updates.  VoiceOver, when focusing on that element, may either only read the accessibility label once to the user (as though it is a static element), or may interrupt itself, trying to keep up with the updating label.</li>
			<li>Sometimes, updating elements have important information that needs to be relayed even when the user is not focused on it.  Without any added code or changes, a sighted user may receive that information visually, but non-sighted users may not.</li>
		</ul>
		There are a few different ways to fix these issues.  We address some solutions below.</p>
		<h3>Potential Solutions</h3>
		<p>Please note that these solutions may not be optimal for every scenario.  As stated before, every situation with updating content is different, so the solutions as to how to make updating content accessible will rely on the situation. Listed below are some potential ideas as to how to make these elements more accessible.</p>
		<h4>"Updates Frequently" Trait</h4>
		<p>There is an Accessibility Trait called "Updates Frequently," located in the Identity Inspector in XCode (pictured below).  If an element updates constantly and VoiceOver is unable to keep up with the updates when focused, the "Updates Frequently" trait might help.  Instead of prompting VoiceOver to notify the user everytime the element updates, VoiceOver only announces an update once every four or five seconds.  More information about Accessibility Traits can be found in our <a href = "DQUAccessibilityTraits.html">blog post</a>.</p>

		<h4>Remove Non-Essential Information</h4>
		<p>While not optimal, if needed, it is possible to programmatically update the Accessibility Label of the updating element, so that VoiceOver only notifies the user with the most important information.  This was briefly mentioned in the earlier example of the clock - instead of announcing the hour, minute, and second every second, the Accessibility Label could be programmed to only contain the hour and the minute.  More information about setting up Accessibility Labels programmatically can be found <a href = "DQUAccessibilityLabels.html">here</a>.</p>
		<h4>UIAccessibilityPostNotification</h4>
		<p>There is a function in XCode called <code>UIAccessibilityPostNotification</code>.   Depending on how it is used, this function can prompt VoiceOver to read out custom notifications or focus on a certain element.  This can be useful if an item requires attention from a VoiceOver user.  More information about this function can be found in <a href = "DQUDynamicNotifications.html">this blog post</a> under "Implementing Dynamic Notifications."</p>
		<h4>Start/Stop Button</h4>
		<p>If <code>UIAccessibilityPostNotification</code> is used too frequently with updating content (such as a progress bar that repeats as soon as it completes), other content may become inaccessible.  For example, let's say I made a progress bar that completes every 10 seconds, and when it completes, VoiceOver focuses on the progress bar and states "Progress Bar Complete."  If the VoiceOver user wanted to read a long paragraph, VoiceOver may, in the middle of the paragraph, switch focus to the progress bar because it completed another cycle.  This would make the paragraph inaccessible to VoiceOver users.  To fix this, implementing a start/stop button, in which the user can stop the progress of the bar so as to access other elements on the page, may solve the problem.</p>
