A short summary to get us grounded and started thinking about your issue.

### Inaccessible Behavior

Describe the behavior you're seeing in detail. 

For example, if we're considering a VoiceOver issue:

1. When I put VoiceOver Focus on an Image
2. And then swipe right
3. Focus moves to the button to the left of the image, instead of the button to the right of the image.

### Accessible Behavior

Include information about the behavior you would like to achieve.

### Defense

Why you believe the behavior is inaccessible. Any applicable references to Section 508, WCAG 2.1, or iOS guidelines references. A reference to any descriptions provided from Attest or Deque Assessments is also helpful!
