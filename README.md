# Demo Application

The main purpose of the application is to build empathy for users with disabilities. It is a simple application that demonstrates the difficulties faced by VoiceOver users in using simple Native iOS Applications. Each demo is composed of a series of examples that show how the concept can be handled inaccessibly, and what the corresponding best practices are.
